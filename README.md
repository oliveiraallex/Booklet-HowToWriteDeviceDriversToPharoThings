# Booklet - How To Write Device Drivers To PharoThings
In this booklet we will show you how to write your own driver using PharoThings library.
We will start to show how works the PharoThings object model and how to use the PharoThings I2C, GPIO and Board libraries. 
At the end, you will be able to write your own drive and send it to the Github oficial project page.
